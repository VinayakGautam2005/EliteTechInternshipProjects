# EliteTech Internship Projects

Welcome to my EliteTech Internship Projects repository! This repository contains all the projects I have completed as part of the EliteTech Internship Program — a comprehensive learning experience focused on practical applications of Python programming, data science, and machine learning.

## About the Internship

The EliteTech Internship is designed to help interns **Learn, Innovate, and Thrive** by working on real-world tasks that enhance employability, confidence, and technical skills. The program encourages self-driven learning and problem solving with professional rigor.

## Internship Tasks Overview

During this internship, I have completed four key projects demonstrating a broad range of skills in Python development:

### Task 1: API Integration and Data Visualization
- Used Python to fetch live data from public APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- Created interactive and insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Delivered a script and a comprehensive visualization dashboard.

### Task 2: Automated Report Generation
- Developed a script that reads data, performs analysis, and generates a formatted PDF report.
- Utilized libraries such as FPDF or ReportLab.
- Delivered both the script and a sample generated report.

### Task 3: AI Chatbot with Natural Language Processing
- Built an AI chatbot capable of understanding and answering user queries.
- Used NLP libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
- Delivered a fully functional Python script and working chatbot.

### Task 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation
- Created predictive models using scikit-learn for classification or prediction tasks (e.g., spam email detection).
- Developed a Jupyter Notebook illustrating model development and evaluation.
